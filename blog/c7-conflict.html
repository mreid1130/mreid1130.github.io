          For those unfamiliar with <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">the compass of shame</a>, I recommend taking a quick look. I found it to be a very interesting look at the way that people deal with conflict. I'm going to go over a recent time when I felt like I could identify with the compass of shame.
          <br><br>
          I recently had a bit of an emotional conflict with a friend of mine. I don't really want to get into details, but the aftermath of the conflict had my compass of shame pointing in a few different directions during the course of our conversation. Since starting DBC, I can confidently say I focus a lot more on my own feelings when interacting with others. Pair programming has really helped me gear up my senses towards my own feelings as well as indicators towards the feelings of others. Anyway, during our conversation I was definitely noticing some of the symptoms from various directions on the compass of shame.
          <br><br>
          The first thing I noticed I did was got a little quiet. Isolation and withdrawing into my own mind has been something I've done a lot in the past when I've been uncomfortable. I immediately recognized my behavior and instead of shielding myself from the conversation with silence, I tried to be more open and engaging. That's when my self-deprecating humor kicks in and my compass shifted east towards "attack self". I tried to make light of a situation, and while that didn't make things worse, that definitely didn't help the situation I was in.
          <br><br>
          I'm sorry if this post is overly vague in terms of the details of the conflict. The source of the conflict was actually relating to my quiet nature and the give and take of friendship, so it's probably a sign I haven't learned my lession from this conflict. I'll be honest, I initially felt a little bit under attack. When I initially tried isolating myself and emotionally "hid", I was making the problem worse. Then when I started putting myself down, it really didn't help at all either and I realized that pretty quickly when my friend didn't seem all that pleased with what I was saying. I realized I really valued my friend's friendship, so I did my best to let my guard down and be vulnerable to discuss the conflict so she could see I was at least trying. I stopped worrying about the shame I felt and decided I really had nothing to feel shame about or hide.
          <br><br>
          I used to think I had to project this image of who I wanted to be to other people and sometimes cover up or hide things I wasn't proud of. I don't think I do this as much anymore, I think I'm really open about who I am and try to be as open a book as possible, but that's clearly not always the case. If I could redo things again, I would be more open about speaking my mind right off the bat. I wouldn't shell up in the face of conflict but do my best to talk through it. I wouldn't put myself down but rather work on better communicating what I was feeling.
          <br><br>
          At the end of the day, it all worked out. I finally opened up and put myself further out than I have in years, and it felt damn good. My friend and I had a great talk and everything was settled. I've had some issues in making REALLY good friends who I felt close to since graduating college. It's just hard to meet people without a class, and my coworkers my age in my office were coming in and out so quickly I never had a chance to develop a really close friendship. I think part of that is because I'm sort of hesitant to open up to people and really let them know who I am, but I realized I shouldn't worry about hiding details or being ashamed of who I am. If they don't like that part of me to the point they don't want to be my friend, why would I want to be their friend? This experience was a bit of a wakeup call for me that relationships take more effort to opening up than I previously thought, but I'm ready to take this newfound knowledge to DBC to hopefully build some lasting relationships.
          <br><br>
          That felt like it started a little slow and vague then got a little sappy and ended just as vague. I try writing these cultural posts with as little re-editing as possible, I want to work on writing from the heart and writing out what I'm feeling, so I do apologize if this is an inarticulate, jumbled mess. I hope it was beneficial to someone else, but it was really helpful for me to write out so I guess that's enough for me!
