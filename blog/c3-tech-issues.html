<h2>Underrepresentation in the Tech Industry</h2>
<p>
I don't believe there is a bigger problem in tech today than the underrepresentation on females and minorities in the workforce, and Google's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/getting-to-work-on-diversity-at-google.html">demographic breakdown</a> confirms just that. The brief report was released in May, 2014, and released some pretty shocking data about the makeup of their workforce.
<br><br>
Only 30% of Google employees are female, despite making up 47% of the US workforce. 61% of workers are white, 30% are Asian, 4% are two or more races, 3% Hispanic, and 2% black. The remaining >1% are classified under "Other". In the report, Google indicates there is a pretty significant pipeline problem, so I'll dive into some of the data they provided.
<br><br>
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind12/c2/c2s3.htm">Only 18% of all computer science degrees</a> are received by women. Meanwhile, black and Hispanic students make up a combined 12% of science/engineering degrees and make up less than 20% of all college grads. It would be interesting to look at the percentage of Google employees with a science/engineering (S&E) degree, but unfortunately I couldn't find any data on that after a little research. Assuming Google's pool is made up of primarily S&E graduates, black and Hispanic students are still quite underrepresented in the industry (<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2014/06/computer-science-programming-code-diversity-sexism-education">women currently make up 20% of software workforce, and black and Hispanics make up about 5% each</a>)
<br><br>
I generally agree with Google's assertion that there is a significant pipeline issue, but coming up with potential solutions is difficult. How do you shift a  culture's perception of an entire industry to create a balanced workforce? 
<br><br>
I think it all has to start in our schools. Kids need to be learning about computer science in elementary school. It doesn't have to be anything super advanced, but building an early foundation of computer literacy can go a long way. When I first started to learn how to program I couldn't avoid the phrase "think like a programmer"... Almost every tutorial, book, article on beginner programming advised me to "think like a programmer". It's a concept I can't really explain because I don't think I've fully grasped it, but my mind shifts into a different gear when I'm coding. It's almost like I'm trying to solve a puzzle and creating the pieces simultaneously. Our schools should frame coding as a creative way to build things and solve problems, because that's exactly what it is.
<br><br>
Introduce concepts to kids early, bring them along slowly, give girls and boys equal exposure to concepts. Students don't need to be ready to be full stack developers when they graduate 12th grade, but give them enough practice and work to help them know if it's something they're interested in. The <a href="http://www.citejournal.org/vol11/iss1/science/article1.cfm">evidence</a> that girls exposed to coding concepts at an early age are more likely to major in computer science is clear as day. Whatever changes that need to be made to our education system to make sure that every single student has some exposure to coding at an earlier age needs to get done. Get on it, America.
