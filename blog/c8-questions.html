<h2>The Art of a Good Question</h2>
<p>
So far DBC's phase 0, there hasn't been a lack of questions racing through my head during every challenge. Depending on the situation, I have a hierarchy of sources I can go to in order to have my question answered. If I'm pairing or in a guided pairing session, I'll first go to my pair to see if they have an answer. If not, I ask the guide, who can usually point me in the right direction towards an answer. But if there is no guide, I consult Google. Finally, if Google isn't able query what I'm looking for, I can post a question on a variety of sources, my favorite being stackoverflow, reddit/r/ruby (or r/javascript, r/learnprogramming, etc), or my DBC cohort's Google+ community. I have yet to post a question on any of these resources that didn't give me a really quality answer and help me not only find my answer, but also led me to some additional and really valuable information.

One of the most important aspects of getting your question answered is having a specific and relevant title. You don't want to be too vague, because if you can concisely summarize your question/problem in the title of your post, there's a much better chance someone who knows the answer will see your post and be able to give you an answer. When I first came across a block of code in Ruby that I totally didn't recognize, ".map(&:join)", I sort of panicked. I was really struggling to understand what was going on, so I decided to make a post on a ruby message board to get some clarification. I titled my post, "Help understanding ".map(&:join)"" because I wanted to be as specific as possible about my problem. Inside my post, I included the context of when this block of code was being used. Within a couple of hours, I had 3 or 4 really high quality answers that not only explained what .map(&:join) did, but thoroughly explained blocks and procs.

Also in that question thread, someone offered me a really good explanation about operations on collections of data, and that there were four broad collection operations: transforming, filtering, iterating, ordering. That really helped solidify the differences between functions like map, each, select, etc.

I had another run in with a ternary operator in an online code example, and I had no idea how to Google what I was looking for. I had been working on a solution to alter only integers in an array, and I was looking for ways to refactor my solution and I saw something that looked like it might be useful, but I couldn't figure out what it was called. Eventually, after a long series of Google searches, I posted a question of my own. I copied my original solution and the bit of code I found online, and was soon presented with another half dozen posts detailed ternary operators and their use in Ruby. The title of this post was more related to the challenge itself, titled, "Modifying only integers in an array". Despite it not being exactly related to ternary operators, which was the focus of my question, I was able to get a lot of traffic through my thread because the title was relatively straight forward. In the thread, I included my original code, the ternary operator code, and a few paragraphs detailing my problem and a quick guess of what the ternary operator was.

In each case, I tried to make a really specific title, then fill in the post with a concise explanation of my problem/question. I also included all relevant code I had worked on or found online. When I followed those simple steps, I was able to get much more information than I could have asked for. One of the best parts about learning web development is the online community. People are so eager and willing to help out beginners without much hesitation which is really really encouraging. Sites like stackoverflow with a huge history of questions make it really easy to find similar questions to one I might have had.
