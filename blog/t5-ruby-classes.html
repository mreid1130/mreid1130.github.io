          Classes in Ruby represent the different categories that Ruby objects can fall into. Things like Arrays, Hashes, and Strings are all types of Ruby classes. As it turns out, even Classes are a Class (don't think too hard about that). For this blog post, I'm going to create a simple class to show an example as to why someone might use a class as opposed to an instance method or instance variable. I'll start off by giving you the code upfront which I'll reference throughout the rest of the blog.

          This is a pretty basic class; it collects and stores the starting lineup of a basketball team. It also has a built in method to print out the lineup in a somewhat formal form. This might sound simple, because it is.
          <br>
          The first part of my class has a series of attr_accessor calls on the variables for each position in the lineup. attr_accessor gives anyone who uses this class the ability to easy read and write over the variables for each position. Say a coach was using this class to map his starting five, he could call Starters#pg to see the name of his starting point guard or set it equal to the name of another player he'd rather start at point guard.
          <br>
          In the initialize method, I set the default values for each position to the Golden State Warriors' (my favorite team) starting lineup. I could have set those values to an empty string instead, which is probably a more functional approach. We then convert each one of those initialize instance variables to a global variable by renaming the variable with an @ in front, which tells Ruby that this variable should be accessable in any method or code in this class. This is an area I could have an argument error, such as requiring the input of a string for each variable, but I wanted to keep this example very simple.
          <br> 
          Now that we've got the names of our starting players, I wanted to create a method to print out the starting lineup in a somewhat aesthically pleasing way, rather than doing something like returning an array or just puts each name, so I created a template for printing in the lineup method. Using the #{@variable_name} notation allows me to access those global variables and embed the values in a string.
          <br>
          And that's all I have for now, but I look forward to playing around with this class a little more and finding ways to make it more functional. I have a few things I've already considered implementing and I'm going to put them below for my own memory's sake, but I'd love to hear ideas on things I could do to improve my class!
          <ul>
            <li>Create a method which outputs a skeleton/outline of how many minutes I want to play each player. For example, if David Lee is coming off an injury I may want to limit him to 30 minutes per game, so implement a method to adjust and print a minutes per game outline.</li>
            <li>Create a method which accepts an array for an entire roster, check to make sure starters are listed on the roster, output starters, output bench players, output entire roster with starter/bench status and allotted minutes.
          </ul>
