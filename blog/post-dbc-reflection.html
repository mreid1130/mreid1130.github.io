<h2>From Dev Bootcamp to Web Developer</h2>

<p>It's been less than a month since I graduated from Dev Bootcamp, and I still maintain that it was one of the most positive experiences of my entire life. Back in November, I was terrified of what I was getting myself into. I thought I might be too introverted, not smart enough, not social adept enough to fit in, but those fears quickly went away once I arrived at DBC.</p>

<p>It's pretty incredible how quickly you bond with your cohort at DBC. After the first week, I felt so at ease when I was around my cohort and my instructors. By the end of phase 1, I felt like I had nearly 40 people I could really trust and rely on. It was a really foreign feeling for me to trust someone, let alone an entire group of people, so quickly. Dev Bootcamp's Engineering Empathy (EE) program is so much more than anything I could have imagined when I first watched Karim's video on EE in phase 0. Every session provokes so much inner-monologue, deep though, and reflection. I was terrified going into every session, fearing for the soul-searching exercise that Karim was about to put us through, but coming out of every session I felt like I knew myself a little better, but I felt exponentially closer to everyone in my cohort. The sessions gave everyone the opportunity to be incredibly vulnerable in a really safe space, and it was so rewarding to be a part of that. </p>

<p>When they say you make your own experience at DBC, they really mean it. The instructors made it clear quite early that they aren't going to checking if we completed our assignments. 'Finishing' an assignment is what's important at DBC, it's about how much you learn. If I was halfway through a challenge and I feel certain I know how to finish it and felt like completing it would just be a matter of going through the motions, I don't have to complete it. My instructor isn't breathing over my shoulder or making sure he has a submission for every student. I loved that environment, it's an environment where I felt I could thrive. Being able to do my own work, experiment, collaborate, and play with the challenges and not have any real pressure other than to soak in as much as I can was so cool. I came into phase 1 expecting DBC to be one giant grind, and in some ways it was, but the amount of fun I had every day really shocked me. In college, I had to drag myself to class. Once I arrived, the lectures were usually bearable. At DBC, I genuinely looked forward to getting into the space every day, seeing my cohort-mates, and problem solving my way through the day's challenge with my pair.</p>

<p>One of the biggest fears I had going into DBC was my ability to pair program. How was I supposed to be matched up with a different random student I barely knew every day for 8 hours and get through a series of really difficult challenges? It was a little daunting. In reality, the challenges bring you closer together. My first two pairing sessions at DBC were two of my favorite pairing sessions as a programmer. Liorr and Juan (my two respective pairs for the first two days) were so empathetic, kind, and really knew their stuff. Working through programming a Roman Numeral converter doesn't seem like it would be a good bonding activity, but it was a great insight into the way someone thinks. It takes the pressure off awkward small talk and onto solving a challenge together. I'm still not sure where I stand on pair-programming as a must for programming/development, but I certainly see the benefits of it. If anything else, pair-programming throughout my time at DBC gave me great practice in working with people who think radically different than I do.</p>

<p>Post-DBC life is a little chaotic. I know some people have taken the "send my resume to anyone with an email address" approach, but I've taken it a little slower and only gone after opportunities where I am passionate about the company and work I'd be doing. I had my first onsite technical interview yesterday afternoon, and I think for the amount of nerves I had going into it, I did okay. I was querying a MongoDB database and basically had to categorize MongoDB documents based on the amount of entries in a certain attribute. I admittedly struggled quite a bit to get started, and I was a little frustrated with myself for that. I don't have a ton of noSQL or MongoDB experience, but I had enough and I felt like I should have been able to come up with a more efficient solution. I was able to 'brute force' my way through the challenge, so I'm giving myself credit for getting a working solution at all in my first technical interview.</p>

<p>Outside of that opportunity, I've got a few leads on more technical interviews which I'm excited about chasing! I wasn't sure what to expect from the 'finding a job' part of my DBC experience, but I'm pretty encouraged by the level of interest I'm getting as a DBC graduate. It seems there is less concern on how developers learn their craft and more on how well developers learn and adapt their craft.</p>

<p>To anyone reading who is considering DBC, I'd recommend it to those who have no problem taking ownership of their experience and their learning. This isn't a program where the instructors are going to hold your hand and hold you accountable for your own work and your own learning. There are opportunities to get feedback from instructors on where you stand against the average DBC student's learning curve, but your own fate very much rests in your own hands.</p>
