        <h2>Dealing With Stereotype Threat</h2>
        <h3>10/24/2014</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="blogtext">
        <p>
          As a white male that was born, raised, and living in the heart of Silicon Valley, stereotype threat is a concept that wasn't really brought up a whole lot in my life. Thus my perspective on the topic probably isn't going to be the most enlightening one out there.
          <br><br>
          From what I understand, stereotype threat is very much a self-handicapping threat. Stereotype threat isn't about peer pressure or societal expectations, but rather expectations someone puts on themselves based on stereotypes they think they should be categorized under. I have definitely been through some phases in my life where I've felt like I should fall into a certain category and feel like I need to wear a certain style and act a certain way because that was what is expected of me. I am talking high school and early college here, a time in my life when self-confidence was not at it's peak and my brain not fully developed (I suppose technically it's still not). In a cringe-worthy look back at high school (probably sophomore year) I have a clear recollection of me thinking to myself that I can't change what I wear because if I do, people will notice and for whatever reason, that is a bad thing. Ridiculous, right? I know that's probably not exactly stereotype threat, because I don't know if there's a stereotype that suburban white males wear shorts and t-shirts every single day, but I felt like I couldn't change what I wore because of a mental block I built myself. It was a pretty helpless feeling but in hindsight it seems so illogical that I didn't do something because of how I was scared how I though someone else might think about my actions.
          <br><br>
          I'm not in high school anymore and I'm over the style-change hurdle (I've moved on from wearing exclusively basketball shorts), but I'm preparring to enter an industry that is comprised of a mostly white-male workforce, as I wrote about on one of my previous <a href="http://mreid1130.github.io/blog/c3-tech-issues.html">blog posts</a>. So how can I react when I think someone is feeling a stereotype threat in an industry where I am the stereotypical worker? My first answer to most problems involving people is clear communication, and I think that holds true for this question. I want to be an open line of communication for people to talk to, but that's easier said than done. I think the key to building trust in a relationship is to be kind, reserve judgement, and speak the truth, and I hope to hold myself to those values during the extent of my time at DBC so that people can feel comfortable enough with me to open up if they feel uncomfortable in a situation where they really feel the pressure of stereotype threat.
          <br><br>
          The three pillars of good feedback at DBC is that feedback should be actionable, specific, and kind. I think criticism and feedback (or lack thereof) can be really stressful on friendships and relationships because people just aren't stupid. If I ask someone for feedback on something (let's say my website) and they blow smoke up my ass or give me a half-hearted, "it looks great", I know it's lip service and it would be a little upsetting that I couldn't get honest feedback on what I was looking for. Creating an environment where honest feedback can be exchanged between all members of the community is a really important step towards creating an environment where people can come forward if they are feeling the pressures of a particular stereotype threat. Again, probably easier said than done, but I'm going to do my best to give honest, kind, actionable feedback whenever I can and make sure that I don't take any critical feedback given to me as a negative or a personal attack.
          <br><br>
          Hopefully by being forthright, honest, and always speaking what's on my mind in a kind way, people will feel comfortable enough around me to feel like they can tell me what's on their mind. I'm not the most outgoing or talkative person, so it's not exactly natural for me to try and delve into other people's emotions but I can really appreciate the feeling of having someone to confide in and discuss problems. Hopefully by always being honest about what I'm feeling in our working relationship, people can confide in me if they feel stereotype threat or are feeling uncomfortable for any other reason.
