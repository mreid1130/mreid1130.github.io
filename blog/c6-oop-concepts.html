        <p>
          I'm going to start off this blog entry with a sort of laundry list of "values". In our assignment for our cultural blog for week 7 of phase 0, our cohort was asked the following question: When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which values come to mind? Here's what I came up with.
          <ul>
            <li>Ambition</li>
            <li>Close relationships</li>
            <li>Inner Harmony</li>
            <li>Competition</li>
            <li>Efficiency</li>
            <li>Growth</li>
            <li>Introspection</li>
            <li>Self-Respect</li>
            <li>Willpower</li>
          </ul>
          I could have selected probably a dozen more that I felt could have been an answer to the question above, but I tried to select only the ones that really resonated with me. If I had to pick one of the above values which I feel is MOST important to me, I'd choose introspection. I consider myself a deep thinker and someone who lives in my own head (fellow introverts will definitely understand where I'm coming from there). That introspection has helped me become more outgoing, more social, happier with myself, more confident in myself, and overall I think I've grown a lot as a person because I spend a lot of time with my thoughts and trying to figure out why I feel a certain way in certain situations, what makes me happy, etc.
          <br><br>
          In general, I try to live up to every single one of those values listed above, 100% of the time, without a doubt. I'm by no means perfect. As an introvert, forming close relationships can be a struggle at times. Having ambition, putting myself out there and having self-respect hasn't always been easy. These values are something I strive for and I think I'm closer to upholding those values in everyday life than I ever have been. I firmly believe that everyone has a set of values that are instilled in them from the experiences of their upbringing. Not everyones values or moral compass points the same way, but I think that having a set of values is really important as it gives people a map to follow in their everyday life. For example, I sort of picked up the efficiency value from my years as an econ major in college. I fell in love with the concept of efficiency, and it's something I think about in almost every single aspect of my life and that's not an overexaggeration. If I'm at the store, I want to be efficient with my money. If I'm going to the gym, I want to be efficient with how I navigate through my list of excercises. Being efficient is something that's always in the back of my mind and guiding my thought process, just like many of those other values guide how I act in social situations, at work, or even when I'm alone.
          <br><br>
          Tying in the idea of values to stereotype threat, I think that if I ever do feel a stereotype threat, introspection, self-respect, and willpower are going to be my friends. Stereotype threat is a self-crippling mindset, and recognizing that I'm under the pressure of stereotype is the first step towards conquering that threat. Being able to respect myself enough to do things that I want to do and be who I want to be instead of trying to please a self-constructed idea of what society thinks I should be is going to be really important. Finally, having the willpower to be who I want to be is going to be the final step. Ultimately, if I can conquer that feeling of stereotype threat once, that will give me enough personal growth and knowledge to conquer stereotype threat pressure if I start feeling it again.
          <br><br>
          Let me know if you have any comments on my entry, I'd love to hear about your own personal values or any feedback on my own thought process behind the role values play in society and people's lives!
