<h2>Becoming a Software Engineer</h2>

<p>Three months ago I wrote about the beginnings of my job search post Dev Bootcamp. I ended up taking an internship with the startup that offered me my first technical interview. They worked with the MEAN stack, which I really loved, and I felt really comfortable with the dev team there. I'd have an opportunity to work with a few other DBC grads and some really talented people, so I ended up deciding that would be the best experience for me, for at least a few months.</p>

<p>I started off working on a lot of web scrapers, pulling events down from major sports teams (both professional and collegiate) and querying our Mongo database. I didn't have any experience building scrapers, so it was definitely a challenge, but there were times I felt like I wasn't learning the necessary skills to become a real software engineer. I eventually become pretty efficient at building scrapers, querying our database, and otherwise fixing minor bugs throughout the rest of the code base. What I failed to realize at the time was how much I was really learning. I was exposed to an entire code base of a production level node API, multiple production level Angular applications, and a MASSIVE database. I eventually gained a reputation in the office as the guy who loved scrapers, and by default anything scraper related came to me. It was kind of nice to have some ownership over something as an intern. Eventually my role expanded, I was given the opportunity to build new API endpoints and take ownership of features that weren't scraper related.</p>

<p>Still, I had some doubts about my progress as an engineer. It wasn't until I started working on a personal project about two months into my internship that I was able to get a view of the bigger picture of my learning. I had started building a Rails application in between DBC and my internship, but it wasn't close to completion. I decided to migrate the backend from Rails/Postgres to Express/Node/Mongo. I decided I was all-in on JavaScript, at least for the time being. There are some things I like about Rails, but a lot of things I hate. Node gives me a lot more freedom, which I love (I can get into my thoughts on Rails vs. Express/Node another time). Anyway, I wanted to make the switch, and ended up building a working node server for the application from scratch in a night's work after I got home from work one night. Not only did I feel confident and comfortable building the application from scratch, but I actually knew what was going on every step of the way. Any time a bug arose, I was able to find the cause and fix it. I looked back at my time at Dev Bootcamp when I was working on my final project with my group. It took me about two days to set up working LinkedIn OAuth using Passportjs, but I had implemented four forms of authentication on this new application in less than an hour. It was really gratifying for me, and I realized I couldn't have done that without the opportunity I had as an intern.</p>

<p>What I realized is that I have a desire to understand how things work. When I see my coworkers push up code to GitHub, I always read it. Well over half the time I don't understand what's going on, but I absorb as much of it as I can. When I don't know what's going on in the code, I do my best to find out. Not only that, but every piece of code that I push up is reviewed by the senior engineer on our team, and I'm always given feedback. The feedback will include things like me forgetting a semicolon to maintain consistent code formatting across our code base, offering creative ways to limit our calls to the Google API and avoid rate-limiting, suggestions on how to make that query on our Mongo DB a little faster, or how to better handle the async flow control of JavaScript. Those little things add up, and I've come to realize that as I continue to learn, I'm able to focus in on minor details that seperates functional code from good code.</p>

<p>My internship is up in June, but just last week I was offered a full-time job, and I took it. I had a long talk with the senior engineer on the team over coffee. He laid out the offer and we discussed what's best for me on my path towards becoming a software engineer. He was honest with me and genuinely seemed like he wanted what was best for me. He offered me some anecdotes on how he got to where he was as an engineer. I really respect him as a friend and mentor, and at no point did he pressure me to take the offer. I decided fairly quickly that I'm still so green as an engineer, so while our code base might not be at the level of Facebook or Google in terms of structure, efficiency, and consistency, I was still learning so much every single day and had a lot of room for growth as an engineer. The offer was fair, and I was excited to be on the team full-time.</p>

<p>I just want to reiterate my happiness for the decision I made to attend DBC. A year ago I was basically unemployeed and really discouraged by where my career was headed. I wasn't being considered seriously for jobs I wanted. I was like a fish out of water trying to learn to code on my own. I didn't have the resources that I personally needed to succeed, and DBC offered me those resources. I wouldn't be where I am without DBC, but I also wouldn't be where I am if I didn't take initiative with my own learning. Every one of my instructors and countless other DBC boots made a huge impact on my learning and I'll always be greatful for the support, but I know at the end of the day, I was always responsible for my own learning and getting to where I am today.</p>
