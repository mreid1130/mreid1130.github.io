        <p>As part of the prep work for DBC, students are asked to take <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">a quiz</a> to determine their personal thinking style. I ended up getting a "concrete random" thinking style, which indicates I am an experimenter, a result I definitely agree with.
        <br><br>
        My biggest struggle so far has been with learning and retaining CSS. Although I feel much better about it now that I've built a basic site followed by an entire re-writing of that code, I initially really struggled with all of the concepts of CSS. I think that partially has to do with the fact that there wasn't a <em>ton</em> of hands on learning in the early stages of our learning. We were given a few videos to watch and completed a few chapters of a CodeSchool (which was pretty glitchy, so I don't think that helped) and CodeAcademy course and I definitely didn't have a good grasp of how to use CSS. Both the online classes felt too much like I was just taking orders. I could do whatever the courses asked without too much issue, but I didn't really understand what I was doing. I clumsily put together a webpage without really knowing what I was doing and settling for things appearing almost where I wanted them to. It wasn't until I had a few pairing sessions building a blog template in week 2 and building a one page site in week 3 that I felt really confident I could make improvements to my first attempt at a website. Although it's still far from perfect, I looked at my code and chuckled a few times just a week after writing it. It wasn't until I got that practical experience before I was really able to start grasping how div's are aligned, what different display values do, and how to build an HTML skeleton that I can scale and replicate.
        <br><br>
        In hindsight, it's clear I didn't get enough hands-on experience early on enough in my learning of CSS. Going forward, I want to make sure I set myself up to get an opportunity to make mistakes and find ways to learn from those mistakes. I'm going to start limiting myself to 30 minutes of research (videos, reading, etc.) followed by 30 minutes of hands-on learning. Hopefully this will prevent me from overanalyzing concepts without getting a chance to put in some practical experience.
        <br><br>
        One of the things that has challenged me thus far is some of the pairing sessions is realizing that although I know a concept and intuitively understand it, I need to do a much better job at being able to communicate how I got an answer. I've had a couple pairing sessions where we've reviewed some answers from Ruby problems I had no problem solving, but when I was asked to explain my thinking/how I got an answer, I really struggled with my explanation. After fumbling over my words and figuring out exactly wanted to say, the concepts became much more solidified in my mind. I think that because I reinforce a lot of my learning with experimentation, I take it for granted how well I truly understand a topic. Being able to effectively communicate lessons learned is going to be a huge area of focus for me. My initial plan of action is going to make sure my reflections for weekly challenges contain a summary of everything I've learned. Hopefully this will help expand the ways I think and learn, so I can continue to have a growth mindset.</p>
