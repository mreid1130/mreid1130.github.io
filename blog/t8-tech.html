          A wise website I stumbled upon once stated, "to understand recursion, first you must understand recursion".
          <br><br>
          In very basic terms, recursion is the act of a function referencing itself in it's own text. If you're at all like me, that probably doesn't help you understand recursion any better. I'm writing this because personally, I've struggled understanding recursion. Just a few weeks ago while working with Ruby, I felt like I had a decent grasp on it. I looked over another assignment the other day which clearly needed a recursive method and realized I had no idea what I was doing, so I thought this was a great opportunity to blog and help solidify the concept.
          <br><br>
          One of the first things I struggled with regarding recursion was how to prevent an endless loop of a method calling itself. To stop a recursive loop, there needs to be some sort of signal to end the recursive loop. These are often referred to as a "base case" in Ruby. After the base case is defined, the method works towards getting closer and closer to the base case. For example if we had a sort of countdown, we'd use a flow control system to figure out if our argument meets our base case expectations.
          <br><br>
          <code>
            def countdown(n)<br>
              return if n.zero? # base case<br>
              puts n<br>
              countdown(n-1)    # getting closer to base case <br>
            end <br>
          </code>
          I pulled this example from StackOverflow, see the whole post <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6418144">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          The example above has a base case that checks if n is equal to 0, and if it is, it will return nothing, and thus break the recursive loop. After the base case, the method puts the argument n on it's own line, and then calls itself again, but this time with n-1. The method will continue printing n on it's own line until n reaches 0, where it won't print anything and the loop will end. Basically, this is a really simple countdown method using an incredibly difficult concept to understand, but hopefully this shows the potential power of recursive methods.
          <br><br>
          To read more on recursive methods, check out <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/recursion/">The Bastards Book of Ruby</a>'s section on recursive method. The author does a really good job of explaining what recursion is to a non programming audience before delving into how it applies to programming.
          <br><br>
          You probably won't fully understand the concept of recursion after this blog post, but hopefully it helps get you started down a path towards being able to understand recursion. I'm still walking down that path and it looks like I have a ways to go, but it's really cool to see the capabilities recursive methods can have while doing some research on the topic.
