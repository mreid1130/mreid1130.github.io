          I'm writing a post on technical aspects of Ruby and Javascript with no internet connection, so this might be a little bit off a struggle to nail down exact details without the ability to do much research. The main point of focus is going to be the differences and similarities between Ruby and JavaScript based on my experiences thus far.
          <br><br>
          In Ruby, there are all sorts of ways to iterate through data structures like arrays and hashes. It's really amazing to look through Ruby documentation and be able to find a powerful method for almost any imaginable task you can think of. Each method in Ruby has a specific way that it needs to be used, otherwise it's going to throw an error. JavaScript seems to be a much broader language, where every task can be completed with the combination of basic built in JavaScript methods and logic. 
          <br><br>
          When discussing JS with my peers, many have been quick to mention how much more difficult it is to navigate and correct an error message in JS. JS is a language that was designed to be really open and broad for the purpose of making it simple and easy to learn, but as an unintended side effect it became a really difficult language to master because of how broadly it was written. To me, that makes JS an incredibly exciting language to learn. I love the logic behind coding, and when I use Ruby I often find myself trying to use logic and really basic functions to solve problems that can be easily solved by one of Ruby's previously mentioned built-in methods.
          <br><br>
          One of the major differences in JavaScript and Ruby is the looping. JavaScript has a few really simple loops (for, while, until, etc.), whereas Ruby has those same loops, plus a ton of ways to iterate through data structures like #each, #map, #delete_if to name a few. Ruby has a much more concise syntax for each of it's loops, which I can really appreciate. The specific yet efficient nature of Ruby's syntax is definitely a major plus in my eyes.
          <br><br>
          Sorry for the broad overview of this post, I usually like to get more specific, but like I said, my internet is out so I don't want to get into too many specifics for fear of posting incorrect information on the internet (no "facts" found on the internet could possibly be incorrect, right?). Hopefully this is somewhat enlightening on the overview of JS and Ruby from a beginners perspective, and I hope I can get this thing posted by a reasonable hour!
