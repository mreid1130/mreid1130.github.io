        <h2>Arrays vs. Hashes</h2>

        <p>There are two types of data structures in Ruby, arrays and hashes. Both arrays and hashes have plenty in common and plenty of things that distinguish one from the other. By the end of this blog, I hope to cover all of the major similarities and differences so that anyone who has read this post will be able to fully understand what differentiates these two data structures.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>What is an Array?</strong></p>
        <br><br>
        <p>An array, simply put, holds data or values. An array can be made up of integers, float values, strings, or even other arrays (these are all called objects). An array opens and closes with a square bracket ( "[" and "]" ). An array is not limited to one type of object, an array can consist of a combination of floats, strings, integers, etc.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>One of the main things differentiating an array from a hash is how the data is indexed. In an array, all data has a numerical index. The first item in an array has an index of 0, the 2nd item has an index of 1, 3rd item has an index of 2 and so on. If I had an array called, my_array, and the array looked something like [1, "two", 3.0, "four", 5], I could access and use the 5th piece of data by calling my_array[4], which would return the value of 5. Although this seems very intuitive and an efficient way to index a data structure, problems arise when you have a very long array (think hundreds of pieces of data), and you want to access a value that is located somewhere in the middle of the array. The index of the array is not easily accessible and would require the programmer to count each piece of data to find out the correct index.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>What is a Hash?</strong></p>
        <br><br>
        <p>One of the main ways that a hash and array are different is the way that they are indexed. While an array has a set numerical indexing system based on the position of data in the array, a hash accepts key-value pairs from the programmer. Here is an example of what a hash might look like with a few key-value pairs, my_hash = {:firstname => "Mark", :lastname => "Reid"}. Both :firstname and :lastname are the keys, which act as the index while "Mark" and "Reid" are values, just like in an array. As you probably can guess, these custom keys make calling on values stored in a large data structure much easier than when using an array.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Calling on values from a hash is almost identical to calling on values in an array. Using the example from the last paragraph, if I wanted to check the value for the :firstname key, I would call my_hash[:firstname], which would return "Mark". Just like an array, a hash value can contain objects like integers, strings, and yes, arrays.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p><strong>When do I use hashes and when do I use arrays?</strong></p>
        <br><br>
        <p>As you can tell by now the main difference between hashes and arrays has to do with how they are indexed. I think the best way for me to recommend when to use a hash vs. an array is to provide a simple "gradebook" example. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Pretend for a few minutes that you are a teacher with a class of 30 students and you want to use Ruby to create a gradebook for your class. When you start grading assignments and setting up your program, you will likely wind up using a combination of hashes and arrays. For each assignment, you may want to create an array with every score from the class. This would allow you to easily calculate the average score, median score, quartile ranges, etc. to help decide whether or not a curve should be implemented. There is no real reason to index these scores in any way in particular, you are just concerned with the raw data.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Obviously you will need to grade each student individually, which is where a hash might come into play. As I mentioned earlier, you can store arrays in a hash value, so for every student (key) you can have a corresponding array (value) containing their scores from every assignment throughout the year. This hash would allow you to easily call on a student's name and output their scores from each assignment without having to memorize their index number in an array. Although that is a pretty specific example of the potential uses for hashes and arrays, hopefully this entry has helped clarify the differences between the two data structures.</p>
