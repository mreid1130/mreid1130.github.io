          5 weeks of Dev Bootcamps phase 0 done, which means my fellow cohorts have made it over halfway through phase 0. That feels pretty good. Throughout the course we've done a lot of work on our own, reading materials, working through problems, etc. But we're also required to "pair" at least twice a week. That basically means we work with a partner to solve a challenge or problem set. 
          <br><br>
          Working with a partner to solve challenges requires a ton of communication, and from what I've experienced so far communication is the single most important factor in having a smooth pairing session. I really wasn't prepared for how much communication was really required my first few pairing sessions. Intuitively I felt comfortable about the material for almost every pairing session so far, but actually explaining that material and teaching it to someone else who might be unfamilar with it is a totally different ball game. Seeing that I was sort of struggling explaining some material without stopping and thinking about it made me realize that I probably didn't know the material as well as I though. Fighting through terrible explanations to finally articulate the explanation I have in my mind really forced me to get a better grasp on material, which is really where I've felt working on challenges with a partner has been most valuable to my learning.
          <br><br>
          On the flip side of that, I had one particularly rough pairing session where I was having trouble grasping what my pair's code was doing while I was the driver. I had seen the problem and actually worked through a solution in my mind about an hour before the pairing session. I don't know what happened, but my brain sort of froze for a few minutes and I couldn't totally follow what he was doing. Luckily my (navigating) pair was awesome and was willing to try and rephrase what he was looking for until I understood what he was asking for. Having a resource to learn from on these challenges is a really incredible thing to have. When one person gets stuck, in every one of my sessions the other person was quick to come up with an idea that ultimately gave us a working solution.
          <br><br>
          The best part about pairing is where you and your pair are on a similar level of understanding and things just click. I had a few sessions, the building an HTML/CSS page from scratch in particular, where I felt like things couldn't have gone any better. We both worked well in both the driver and navigator roles, we both had a really good grasp on the material, so the driver almost never had any trouble writing out what the navigator asks. When we got stuck or something wasn't working correctly, we used google and were able to find a solution really quickly and talked the other person through the new method if they were unsure.
          <br><br>
          The last part of pairing is receiving feedback. I wasn't sure how I was going to react, but getting feedback is really refreshing. Getting an additional perspective of honest feedback really helps me with what to really take away from a session. If I got no feedback after a session and had this idea that we worked really well together, my pair understood everything I was saying, etc. and it turns out my pair thought it was a horrible session for whatever reason, then I didn't get what I should have out of that pairing session. If I am able to receive some of that constructive feedback, I can think back on the sessions and begin to recognize areas I can improve as a pair.
          <br><br>
          Based on my current feedback, I need to keep focusing on communicating and being open to the ideas of my peers. I've received really positive feedback on those things, which I thought was going to be a huge area I needed to improve upon. I tried to go into pairing sessions with a mindset that I'm going to overexplain everything. I'm not a very talkative person, so I figured what may be overexplaining to me is normal to someone else. That mindset seems to be paying off, so I hope that I can keep it moving forward!
          <br><br>
          Writing constructive feedback for a partner can sometimes be difficult when you feel the pairing session went really well. Like I mentioned above, sometimes pairing sessions feel like they couldn't be better. Giving someone really soft feedback because you don't want to offend them doesn't help either person. I tried my best to give some sort of constructive feedback to every pair, no matter how trivial it seemed.
          <br><br>
          Overall, pair programming has been one of the most effective tools in my learning so far. The sessions force you and your pair to understand and solve a problem. It requires everyone to be on the same page, and it's a pretty amazing way to learn. We've only had limited exposure to pairing so far in phase 0, and I can't imagine how much will be learned going almost an entire 9 weeks pairing. It's really exciting, and also slightly frightening to think about. I really do enjoy working and solving problems alone but I've run into so many walls trying to work through concepts on my own and spending so much time researching for documentation that I can really grasp. Having a pair gives you an additional human resource who is going to do their best to help me understand, so I know that's going to be a huge benefit to my learning.
