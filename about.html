      <div class="aboutbody">
        <p>I was born and raised in the Bay Area, educated at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA, and have been working as an search engine optimization (SEO) specialist for <a href="http://www.universalgiving.org">UniversalGiving</a> in San Francisco, CA since graduation. I thoroughly enjoyed my work at UniversalGiving and wouldn't trade the experience I had at that organization for anything. As an SEO specialist, I had to have basic working knowledge of HTML, so I decided to work through the CodeAcademy course for HTML and CSS. While going through that course, I realized how much I enjoyed building and problem solving in HTML, so I decided to branch out and try some of the other courses. After a few weeks of coding, I made my way through the Ruby, Python, and Javascript courses, but I didn't feel like I could use these languages in any practical way, so I felt a little stuck. I've always learned best when I totally immerse myself in a subject, and Dev Bootcamp is giving me the opportunity to do just that with web development. </p>
