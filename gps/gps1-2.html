                <h2 class="header1">What is pair programming?</h2>
                <p class="pstyle">The best way to pair program is to think of it as a partnership. Each pair has a driver and a navigator. The driver tends to do most of the typing and the actual code work. The navigator directs the driver and focuses on the big picture.</p>

                <h2 class="header1">Why is pair programming important to DBC??</h2>
                <p class="pstyle">Pair programming is important to DBC because it promotes teamwork, allows people to give and receive feedback, and gives additional perspective on how others program.</p>

                <h2 class="header1">Compare Driver and Navigator</h2>
                <p class="pstyle">The driver essentially types the code and is the main medium between computer and output. The navigator is similar lays out a roadmap for the driver to follow, they create the map and tell the driver how to follow the map.</p>

                I had a great time pairing with Kevin. I think we both worked well together, listened to each other's ideas, and held a really good dynamic between driver and navigator.
